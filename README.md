# Artiller

Artiller is a website that is designed to recommend online articles and blog posts. It allows users to search for articles based on a term, their tags, or a link, and, based on the article’s tags, author, an analysis of the source text, and the publishing date, recommends similar articles that the user might want to read. The website will also display an abridged version of the article so that users don’t have to go to the whole page if they don’t want to - similar to Reader Mode in browsers.
